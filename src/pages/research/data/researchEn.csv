The use of a global shutter high-speed image sensor as a receiver has been widely examined in ITS-VLC so far. However, this image sensor is impractical for general-purpose applications due to the high cost. This study aims to perform ITS-VLC using the rolling shutter image sensor. The rolling shutter image sensor is widely used in the smartphone camera. By using it as a receiver, ITS-VLC can be used in more opportunities. In this study, we propose a ITSVLC system using rolling shutter image sensor. The proposed system demodulates data from images captured in a moving environment.

"Z. Tang,T. Yamazato, S.

Conventional camera-based VLC suffers from low data rates and high latency due to the limited camera frame rates. To solve this problem, the event camera has been used as the receiver in VLC. Event cameras detect changes in brightness and asynchronously output these changes as events in microsecond order. The high temporal resolution gives the event camera-based VLC good potential in terms of high speed and low latency. However, when an event camera is used as the VLC receiver, the light of the transmitter needs to be changed constantly. If the transmitter LED is continuously in the same blinking state, the event camera may not output any events and the data could not be recovered until the blinking state changes. To transmit the optical signal for event cameras, we use a propeller-type rotary LED transmitter for the event camera-based VLC. The transmitter rotates the blinking LED in circles and uses the afterimage of LED light to transmit signals. The event camera detects the afterimages and constantly outputs them as a stream of events. We filter the noise events and recover data using signal events. This study verifies the operation for the proposed system through an implementation experiment. As a result, we achieved the communication in the proposed system and provided a basic evaluation in terms of communication speed and quality.","May 2022",

The rotary LED transmitter was developed to increase the data rate of ISC using afterimages of LED lights. The transmitter simultaneously causes the LEDs to blink and rotates them around a vertical axis. Owing to the movement of the blinking LEDs that occurs within the exposure time of the camera, multiple blinking states are captured as afterimages, thus increasing the amount of information that can be received per image. However, with increasing communication distance, the size of the LED light captured on the image sensor decreases. In this case, it is difficult to distinguish each LED blinking state, leading to a degradation of the demodulation performance. To overcome this problem, the proposed STC encodes adjacent angular afterimages as symbol pairs and transmits these symbol pairs using two symbol times. In addition, we simplified the data decoding process by using normalized LED luminance values. We evaluate the demodulation performance of the proposed method through experiments. Compared with conventional coding methods, the proposed STC requires no channel estimation and significantly improves the demodulation performance.","Feb. 2022","https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2021.3137601"

Unfortunately, OWC is currently relegated to a limited role in any 5G scenario, but the debate whether this is unavoidable has yet to be settled. Whether OWC is adopted post 5G or 6G is not the vital issue; rather, the aim should be that OWC coexists with 5G and 6G communication technologies. In working toward this goal, research and development in OWC will continue to extend its benefits and standardize its systems so that it can be widely deployed in the market. For example, given that a standard already exists for a visible-light beacon identifier and Li-Fi, a service using this standard should be developed to satisfy user demand.

In previous research, LEO-MIMO communication requires control signals to estimate the Doppler frequencies of each satellite. The control signal is allocated a different frequency band to avoid inter-carrier interference with other signals. However, as the number of communication LEO satellites increases, the bandwidth of the control signal becomes wider and the bandwidth for the MIMO signal becomes narrower. In other words, the problem is that the capacity of LEO-MIMO decreases with the increase in the number of communication LEO satellites. Therefore, this study attempts to suppress the communication capacity reduction by superimposing control signals. This technique can improve the bandwidth of the control signal is constant regardless of the number of satellites, and suppress capacity reduction regardless the number of satellites. On the other hands, superimposed control signals technique degrades the Doppler frequency estimation accuracy due to inter-carrier interference. To tackle of the problem, we propose the novel Doppler frequency estimation using Deep learning techniques.

The superposition of the control signals occupy only a frequency bandwidth of one control signal, thus can prevent the capacity reduction. A challenge is how to estimate each satellites’ Doppler frequency from the superimposed control signal.

Communication in this scheme depends on the quality of images transmitted from the LED to the sensor. If the image becomes unfocused on the way to the receiver, the LED luminance that make up the signal cannot be detected, so the receiver cannot demodulate the signal data. To overcome this problem, this study proposes a novel demodulation scheme to recover data from a degraded image, based on a maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) algorithm. The proposed method creates template images that imitate all possible blinking patterns produced by the LED transmitter, and then calculates the Euclidean distances between pixels in the captured image and the pseudo images for all possible blinking patterns. Finally, the algorithm chooses the image template with the smallest Euclidian distance from the received signal as the recovered data. Though an exhaustive set of image templates must be prepared for the proposed MLD, the number of templates depends on the number of LEDs on the transmitter. Thus, the computational complexity of this method increases as the number of transmitter LEDs increases. To reduce the computational complexity of the proposed MLD algorithm, the binary differential evolution (BDE) algorithm is used, which is a swarm intelligence technique. Computer simulations are used to evaluate the BDE algorithm's usefulness for reducing computational complexity and improving the BER of the communication system.","Apr. 2019","https://doi.org/10.1587/nolta.10.173"

This paper explores the applicability of SR in a BPSK receiver with sub-threshold signals. Although received signals are amplified as a result of the nonlinear behavior of the receiver, they are somewhat distorted. This results in the lower performance of SR receivers in comparison with linear receivers. Employing a parallel network of SR systems is expected to solve this problem. The present theoretical analysis demonstrates that in a certain noise intensity range, the output of the network can fully describe an input sub-threshold signal, and hence, the performance close to that of the linear receivers can be obtained. The effectiveness of the SR receiver was also demonstrated through a numerical example of the bit error rate (BER). However, achieving good BER performance requires an infinite number of arrayed SR systems, which is not realistic in practical systems. A design framework for an SR network with a finite number of elements and an appropriate noise intensity that can realize BER performance close to that in linear systems is also provided.","Jan. 2019","https://doi.org/10.1587/nolta.10.106"

Moreover, the appropriate source code is needed to achieve the channel capacity because the transmission channel is asymmetric in the present reception scheme.","Sep. 2018","https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2851583,28616"
"T. Yamazato","Image Sensor Communications for Automotive","Progress In Electromagnetics Research Symposium (PIERS), Toyama International Conference Center, Toyama, Japan","This article introduces image sensor communications (ISC), a subset of visible light communication (VLC), that use high-speed image sensor and its application to automotive. Li-Fi (light fidelity) and OCC (optical camera communication) or also know as CamCom are also VLC family. Li-Fi is a high-speed wireless system and is currently in the process of being standardized in IEEE 802.11. The OCC uses an ordinary camera, e.g. a smartphone camera, as a receiver while ISC uses a high-speed image sensor as a reception device.  The principal component of a camera, an image sensor, is used for both ISC and OCC. The main difference is that ISC focuses on a high-speed image sensor while OCC concentrates on low-cost consumer applications using smartphones and similar contemporary devices. For automotive usage, a high-speed image sensor is the best choice for the VLC receiver because the image sensor has a spatial separation of noise and target source. The VLC family uses LED as the transmitter and LED light sources are everywhere on streets: in signs, traffic lights, street lights, and other stationary objects. So if we can send IDs or exact location data (latitude and longitude) by way of VLC from those LEDs, then they can be used as anchor nodes placed on roads, sidewalks, or landmarks. Those anchor nodes help autonomous cars and connected vehicle for robust navigation with centimeter accuracy. The image sensor is the suitable detection device as it can be used for both positioning and VLC data detection. The author has been working on ISC for automotive applications. In this article, some of the author research, as well as his findings, are introduced. ","Aug. 2018",

Our goal in this study is to develop a precise tracking method. To accomplish this, vehicle vibration modeling and its parameters estimation, i.e., representative frequencies and their amplitudes for inherent vehicle vibration, and the variance of the Gaussian random process representing road surface irregularity, are required. In this paper, we measured actual vehicle vibration in a driving situation and determined parameters based on the frequency characteristics. Then, we demonstrate that vehicle vibration that induces transmitter displacement in an image plane can be modeled by only Gaussian random processes that represent road surface irregularity when a high frame rate (e.g., 1000 fps) image sensor is used as an ISC receiver. The simplified vehicle vibration model and its parameters are evaluated by numerical analysis and experimental measurement and obtained result shows that the proposed model can reproduce the characteristics of the transmitter displacement sufficiently.","Jan. 2018","https://doi.org/10.1587/transfun.E101.A.176"

In practice, the symbol rate of this paper is R/(m + 1) because a guard slot is inserted every m slots. In the superimposed system, N data streams where the symbol rate of the nth data stream, n = {1, 2, . . . , N}, is 1/(m + 1)n-1 times the symbol rate of the first data stream are combined to form a pulse-width modulated (PWM) wave with a period time T. An IS receiver with a camera operating at a frame rate of R/(m + 1)n-1 fps demodulates data streams whose symbol rate is R/m + 1)n symbol/s or lower. Our experimental results validate that from a superimposed PWM wave of 500-symbol/s and 125-symbol/s data streams, a 2000-fps camera receiver demodulates both of the two data streams and the 500-fps camera receiver does the 125-symbol/s data stream successfully, without shortening individual error-free transmission ranges, compared with non-superimposed systems in which 500-symbol/s and 125-symbol/s data streams are independently transmitted by different light emitting diode (LED) transmitters and received by 2000-fps and 500-fps camera receivers, respectively.","Dec. 2017","https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254784"

The UTMS is a traffic management system beneath the National Police Agency of Japan. Currently, 55 000 UTMS infrared beacon systems have been installed, and they provide expressway and ordinary road information to cars. However, the data rate is 1 Mbps, and a faster data rate is necessary to support automotive and smart mobility devices. In this paper, we propose an uplink V2I system for the UTMS. The system is designed to match the current beacon system as closely as possible, so that the system can easily be replaced and still provide sufficient bandwidth for future automotive and smart mobility devices. We adopt a photo diode (PD) as the VLC receiver and a commercially available off-the-shelf LED headlight as a transmitter. Unfortunately, the bandwidth of such an LED is usually small, so we consider applying a bit-loading algorithm to direct-current-biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing. To reduce strong background noise, such as from the sun, we narrow down the field-of-view by applying a lens to the PD, which forms a tiny communication area, smaller than the current infrared beacon system. We then consider multiple PDs with the lens to create a similar communication area as the infrared beacon system. As a result, we achieve 3.1-Mbps throughput.","Oct. 2017","https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2759179"

Toward the future in which vehicles are connected anytime and anywhere by optical signals, the cutting-edge camera receiver employing a special CMOS image sensor, i.e., the optical communication image sensor (OCI), has been prototyped, and an optical V2V communication system applying this OCI-based camera receiver has already demonstrated 10-Mb/s optical signal transmission between real vehicles during outside driving. In this paper, to reach a transmission performance of 54 Mb/s, which is standardized as the maximum data rate in IEEE 802.11p for V2X communication, a more advanced OCI-based automotive VLC system is described. By introducing optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (opticalOFDM), the new system achieves a more than fivefold higher data rate. Additionally, the frequency response characteristics and circuit noise of the OCI are closely analyzed and taken into account in the signal design. Furthermore, the forward-current limitation of an actual LED is also considered for long operational reliability, i.e., the LED is not operated in overdrive.

Although a considerable amount of research has focused on indoor VLC systems using singleelement photodiodes, there remains a need for channel modeling of VLC systems for outdoor mobile environments. In this paper, we describe and provide results for modeling image sensor based VLC for automotive applications. In particular, we examine the channel model for mobile movements in the image plane as well as channel decay according to the distance between the transmitter and the receiver. Optical flow measurements were conducted for three VLC situations for automotive use: infrastructure to vehicle VLC (I2V-VLC); vehicle to infrastructure VLC (V2I- VLC); and vehicle to vehicle VLC (V2V-VLC). We describe vehicle motion by optical flow with subpixel accuracy using phase-only correlation (POC) analysis and show that a single-pinhole camera model successfully describes these three VLC cases. In addition, the luminance of the central pixel from the projected LED area versus the distance between the LED and the camera was measured. Our key findings are twofold. First, a single-pinhole camera model can be applied to vehicle motion modeling of a I2V-VLC, V2I-VLC, and V2V-VLC. Second, the DC gain at a pixel remains constant as long as the projected image of the transmitter LED occupies several pixels.

Consequently, STC offers extended transmission distance to pixel-resolution-limited IS-based VLC links.

We examined that for low-resolution IS-based VLC channel where intensity modulated signals from two different light emitting diodes (LEDs) are detected at one pixel on the image plane, STC allows to decouple them, thus receiving data with no errors. Consequently, STC offers extending the transmission distance. In the layered STC presented here, additional bit streams are aligned in the 2n×2n LED array for increasing the transmission rate per symbol duration for the case where the spatial resolution is improved. A prototype of three layered STC is built with an 8×8LED array, where each of the LEDs is modulated at 1 kbps and a high-speed camera with IS operating at 1000 fps. Our experimental results validate that additional bit streams (layer-2 and -3), aligned in the layer-1 STC matrix pair, are extracted with no errors when the receiver comes within 155m and 55 m, respectively, from the LED array, without decreasing 210m of the transmission distance of layer-1 bit stream.","Jun. 2015","https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2015.7249124"

Although multiple LEDs of an array are used as transmitters to communicate to individual pixel elements of an image sensor which act as multiple receive elements, the received signal is essentially the image of the transmitting element, whose size in pixel reduces with distance. When the receiver captures the LED array at a distance where images of two neighboring LEDs in the array are not separated at the image plane, such distortion depreciates the symbol decision quality.

Particularly, an image sensor based OWC systems consist of the LED transmitters and camera receivers are expected to contribute to intelligent transport system (ITS) for driving supports. For high achievable data rates, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based OWC systems have attracted a great deal of attention. Despite attractive features of optical OFDM, only few attempts have so far been made to adopt it as a modulation scheme of an image sensor based OWC system. There remains a need for an evaluation of adopting an optical OFDM to the image sensor based OWC systems. Another important issue needs to be addressed is the performance degradation due to a frequency response of an actual image sensor device, especially a signal attenuation loss in higher frequency. In addition to such loss, a narrow band noise generated by its circuits also degrades the performance. The purpose of this paper is to investigate BER performances of the optical-OFDM using an actual image sensor device, the optical communication image sensor (OCI). From simulation results, it is found that the frequency response and the narrowband noise at 12MHz of the OCI lead to the significant reduction of BER performances. Additionally, the results shows that ACO-OFDM shows a little better performance compared to DCO-OFDM with the same bandwidth efficiency.","Nov. 2014","https://doi.org/10.1109/APCCAS.2014.7032786"

The M-ary modulation scheme can transmit b-bit data at a time by using M=2b distinct sequences.

In advance, each data symbol among M symbols is allocated to each interleaver-deinterleaver pair. The transmitter selects an interleaver corresponding to a data symbol and separates the order of samples of the chaotic sequence using the selected interleaver. The receiver feeds the received sequence into all M deinterleavers and outputs M reconstructed sequences. The proposed system can reconstruct the original chaotic sequence only when the correct deinterleaver, which becomes paired with the interleaver, is selected. Therefore, the receiver can recover b-bit data by analyzing the chaotic dynamics of each reconstructed sequence.

Although multiple LEDs of an array are used as transmitters, the received signal is essentially the image of the transmitting element, whose size in pixel reduces with distance. When the receiver captures the LED array at a distance where images of two neighboring LEDs in the array are not separated at the image plane, such distortion depreciates the symbol decision quality. Our proposed scheme aims at expanding the communication range limited by the pixel resolution of image sensor. Our implemented prototype demonstrates that ST coding is feasible to achieve 48,m error-free transmission range while the repetition transmission achieves 26,m error-free range.","Feb. 2014",

LEDs are extremely energy-efficient and predicted to become widespread in general lighting application.  Because LED is a solid-state lighting device, it can be modulated at high-speed compared with other lighting sources.  VLC uses LEDs, which send data by flashing light at speeds undetectable to the human eye.Widespread use of LEDs in traffic applications and growing interest in Intelligent Transport System (ITS) presents an opportunity for VLC.  Data transmission using LED traffic lights, LED road illumination, and LED brake lights are typical application. In this paper, an on-going research, road-to-vehicle visible light communication, will be introduced.  The LED array, assumed to be an LED traffic light, is used as a transmitter and it sends data to a moving vehicle.  By providing data together with a traffic signal that is visible to a driver, a safety driving support can be realized. Finally, the author suggests readers a glimpse of wealth on “dual use of LEDs” and concludes the paper.","Jan. 2014",

So as to improve the transmission reliability, an error correcting code like a low-density parity-check (LDPC) is applied to the road-to-vehicle VLC system. The decoder of the LDPC code needs channel information in order to maximize decoding performance. Usually, it is calculated from a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or bit error rate (BER) of a channel, where noise is a dominant factor of the channel characteristic. In the road-to-vehicle VLC system, not noise but interference among LEDs decides the channel characteristic. In this paper, we propose a channel information estimation method for the road-to-vehicle VLC system. The proposed method estimates a signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) from the receiving image, and calculates the channel information using the SIR. The proposed method is evaluated by experiment. As a result, the proposed method can achieve almost the same performance with the optimum case, and then maximize the decoding performance.

The traffic light is composed of a hundred of LEDs on two dimensional plain. In this system, data is sent as two dimensional brightness patterns by controlling each LED of the traffic light individually, and they are received as images by the camera. Here, there are problems that neighboring LEDs on the received image are merged due to less number of pixels in case that the receiver is distant from the transmitter, and/or due to blurring by defocus of the camera. Because of that, bit error rate (BER) increases due to recognition error of intensity of LEDs To solve the problem, we propose a method that estimates the intensity of LEDs by solving the inverse problem of communication channel characteristic from the transmitter to the receiver.

BFDM was invented to reduce the interference through a flexible design of signal pulse shaping. However, the shape of Gaussian pulses used in BFDM is not always optimized in every situation and as a result the interference is not always minimized. This research is to optimize the shape of Gaussian pulse. In particular, we optimize the Gaussian pulse in BFDM by maximizing the ratio of the ambiguity function of the transmitter (Gaussian) and its receiver pulses.

In cooperative transmission, energy consumption is balanced among the nodes because of the use of another node as a relay for data transmission of distant nodes. The conventional scheme to select a relay node is based on available battery energy and the expectation of energy consumption of each node.

Conventionally, the hierarchical coding has been realized through the wavelet transform that has a limitation of number and disposition of LEDs, and as a result it does not always match with the design of the transmitters (e.g. traffic lights, etc.) used in real life. To solve the limitation problem, we propose a more flexible way of designing the application of LEDs depending on the transmitters. In particular, overlay coding is realized through the procedures of coding and decoding. In coding, we replace one LED with a flexible number of LEDs, and the number depends on whether the data is high-priority or low-priority, then high-priority data and low-priority data are overlaid. In decoding, we first obtain the high-priority data, and then the low-priority data using retrieved high-priority data. The experimental result shows that the distance for receiving error-free data is extended from 30m to 70m in the overlay coding.","Oct. 2011","https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2011.6082943"

"T. Yamazato, S. Haruyama","[Tutorial]  Visible Light Communications","IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), Kyoto, Japan","Visible light communications (VLC) is the latest optical wireless communications technologies that uses low-power light emitting diodes, or LEDs, not only to provide light but also to broadcast data. LEDs are extremely energy-efficient and predicted to become widespread in general lighting application. It is expected that LED market will reach $29 billion in 2017 that is comparable to today's NAND and DRAM markets [1]. Because LED is a solid-state lighting device, it can be modulated at high-speed compared with other lighting sources. VLC uses LEDs, which send data by flashing light at speeds undetectable to the human eye. The pioneer of VLC using LEDs is Professor Masao Nakagawa of Keio University. His first paper on this subject appeared in the early 2000, together with his successor Prof. Shinichiro Haruyama, the instructor of this tutorial. Later in 2003, he formed Visible Light Communication Consortium (VLCC). Now VLCC is lead by Prof. Haruyama. Please see the following video, an interview of Prof. Haruyama about VLC, which has been broadcast by NHK World in June 4, 2009. http://www.naka-lab.jp/movie/nhk_world.wmv So far various experimental VLC systems and prototypes are demonstrated. Such includes 4.8kbps visible light ID as an infrastructure to mobile-terminal application, independent sound transmission through RGB visible lights and 100Mbps VLC wireless LAN system. Using LED array, the data rate of 1 Gbps achieved by Keio University (Prof. Haruyama) that is the fastest at the moment [1]. In terms of longer range, there has been a demonstration by VLCC that achieved 1kbps transmission of the distance 2km, that is the world's longest distance for VLC. Samsung and ETRI are also active in developing VLC applications. They have demonstrated 120Mbps full duplex mobile-to-mobile transmission and 100Mbps signboard transmission. Please see the following video of Nakagawa lab. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEh5f49LsB4 Widespread use of LEDs in traffic applications and growing interest in Intelligent Transport System (ITS) presents an opportunity for VLC. Data transmission using LED traffic lights, LED road illumination, and LED brake lights are typical application. Dr. Yamazato, the instructor of this tutorial, is a leader in VLC application to ITS and he recently achieved 16kbps data transmission and distance up to 70m in a driving situation with a vehicle moving with 30km/h. Today VLC using LED is a hot topic and VLC projects have been initiated in Europe and US. In 2006 Siemens launched VLC project. Later in 2008, European Commission established OMEGA project with a consortium of 20 European partners from industry and the scientific community [3]. Meanwhile, in 2008, the US National Science Foundation has approved a grant of $18.5 million to help establish and the Engineering Research Center focuses on VLC. The members of the Center include the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, Boston University and the University of New Mexico. The University of California also have launched five-year research project called the Ubiquitous Communication by Light (UC-Light) that is founded with $3.5 million from the University. The project is anticipated to begin in 2009 and run for five years. VLC is in the process of standardization by the IEEE 802.15 TG7 and VLCC as well as other standard organizations. The first VLC specification standard was released from JEITA in conjunction with VLCC in 2007. Later in 2008, VLCC released their first specification standard adopting and expanding the IrDA physical layer. IrDA transceiver transmission wavelength (IrDA physical layer) is expanded to accommodate the visible light wavelength. By adapting this specification, the existing IrDA optical modules can be used for VLCC data transmission with slight modification. In January 2009, IEEE 802.15 (Wireless Personal Area Networks) Task Group 7 (Visible Light Communication) has been launched. At the 6th meeting held in November 2009 they adopted the baseline draft text for the development of the 802.15.7 standard. The goal of this tutorial is to introduce current VLC technology and its trends. Starting with an overview of VLC, participants will learn basics of VLC, on-going standardization activities and VLC. We will provide some experimental results and furthermore detail to enhance VLC application. ","Jun. 2011",

This feature gives the receiver additional information to correctly recover the information data and thus improves the bit error performance of the receiver. As results of the computer simulation, we confirm that the advantage gained in BER performance of the proposed error-correcting method is about 1-1.5 dB compared to conventional method.

In addition, a new wireless control method is proposed to improve performance of cooperative motion when the channel errors occur. As an example of the controlled objects, rotary inverted pendulums with wireless connections in feedback loops are considered. In this study, we select a simple setting for cooperative motion, two rotary inverted pendulums are operated symmetrically. In order to improve the synchronization of their cooperative motion, we propose a system in which each pendulum receives control signals of it and also of the other pendulum. In addition, the main controller generates control signals for them based on the state information of both objects. The proposed system provides a better performance of cooperative motion than a conventional system with two independent feedback loops does. ","Jun. 2010",

In this system, all users or passengers are on trains. Thus there is high concentration in user distribution, and a group of the users on a train move to the same direction with the same speed. In such a system, when two opposite trains enter in the same cell before they pass each other, the number of users in the cell abruptly increases, and forced terminations of communication, i.e. call dropping, may occur due to the concentration of traffic. This paper proposes access control methods that mitigate the probability of the dropping, by limiting the number of channels allowed to use on each train dynamically or statically before the two trains enter the same cell. As a result, it is shown that the probability of the forced termination of an existing call can be decreased with the cost of increase in blocking probability. It is also confirmed that the dynamic access control method can inhibit increase of the rejection of newly arrived calls compared to the static access control method when the control duration is enough large. In conclusion, the proposed methods provide lower dropping probability than the conventional(no-control) system, under the same blocking probability. ","Oct. 2009",

The LEDs in the transmitter are emitted in 500Hz and those emitting LEDs are captured by a high-speed camera for making communication. Here, the luminance value of each LED in the transmitter should be found for consecutive frames to achieve effective communication. For this purpose, first the transmitter should be identified, then it should be tracked for consecutive frames while the vehicle is moving, by processing the images from the high-speed camera. In our previous work, the transmitter was identified by getting the subtraction of two consecutive frames. In this paper, we mainly introduce an algorithm to track the identified transmitter in consecutive frames. Experimental results using appropriate images showed the effectiveness of the proposal.","Jul. 2009",

Thus, it performs well in the time-frequency dispersive channels and is considered to be a promising candidate for the next generation mobile communications modulation scheme. However, in the highly mobile environment the performance deteriorates and channel equalization and estimation schemes became essential for further improvement of BFDM/OQAM systems. This paper proposes a novel adaptive channel estimator based on a Kalman filter. We approximate the channel state  with a number of samples of its  fading  processes at  each delay tap. The idea behind our estimator is to employ a linear predictor to derive a process equation for the Kalman filter. To reduce the convergence time the bayesian estimation is employed to provide an initial value for the Kalman filter.

In order to realize the spectrum sharing, spectrum sensing that detects the presence of a primary user signal is a key technology. For reliable sensing of the primary signal, cooperative sensing where information from multiple sensing nodes is incorporated at a fusion center is currently being investigated by many researchers. Majority of these works consider the imperfectness of the channels between a primary transmitter and sensor nodes under noise and fading environments. On the contrary, this manuscript deals with the transmission between sensor nodes to a fusion center. For a cooperative spectrum sensing system, in which the analog outputs of energy detectors at sensor nodes are transmitted to a fusion center, the influence of losses of information from the nodes on detection performance is derived analytically.

In the proposed scheme, the secondary system modifies its transmitting signal parameters adapting channel states and transmitted signal of the primary system. This set of reference information is also used at the receiver of the secondary system. We derive the symbol error rates of both the systems analytically, and show that it is possble to realize the communication of the secondary system with the same quality as the primary system, which has any degradation by the signal of the secondary system.","May 2008",

In order to combat indoor fading and shadowing, an STBC cooperative relaying scheme, which uses multiple transmit and receive antennas together with multiple relay terminals, is introduced. In the proposed scheme each relay terminal transmits all STBC branch-signals with random phase rotations, and no exchange of information between the relay terminals is required to achieve high diversity order. In numerical evaluations, the proposed scheme is compared with conventional deterministic signal assignment or random branch selection schemes using average and outage probability of the frame-error rate as performance measures.

The joint decoding scheme that uses the correlation between the observed data sequences can reduce bit errors in the wireless channel. In this paper, we extend the joint decoding to the case of more than two-hop transmission. For such extension, selection of fusion scheme is very important issue. If the global fusion scheme is employed and the observed data sequence of each sensor node is transmitted on an independent route, route diversity effect could be obtained by using the correlation between observed data sequences.

The optimum range for an ADC input amplitude is found as a result of the trade-off between quantization error and the effects of clipping. In addition, it is shown that the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the signal is not a good measure of the bit error rate (BER) performance, since the largest peaks occur only with very low probabilities. The relationship between the location of a subcarrier and its performance is studied.

In comparison with a long range radar, a short range radar needs wide angular range. Therefore a radar network which is set at front of a vehicle with multiple radars is being considered. The short range radar system also needs estimating obstacle positions with high accuracy. Therefore, by this research, we consider improving accuracy of the position estimation with the radar network. We use MMSE (Minimum Mean Square Error) and estimate parameters to get accurate positions from ranges measured by multiple radars. For MMSE, we consider three methods which differ in terms of objective functions to minimize or parameters to estimate. For these methods, we evaluate position estimation characteristics using computer simulations. We show that each method has characteristic performance at environment of use of cars.","Apr. 2006",

In this scheme, multiple replicas of a coded packet are transmitted along different disjoint routes from a source node. These replicas are received, combined and decoded by the destination. If a conventional multipath routing protocol, such as MDSR, is employed, smaller hop routes tend to be selected to transmit packets. However, the performance of MRPC depends on the packet reception probability and the bit error rate of each route. It is therefore expected that the performance mproves if these statics are utilized as a route selection metric. In this paper, we compare the packet error performance of MRPC for different route selection metrics. Three different metrics are considered, that is, the log-likelihood ratio (LLR), the packet reception probability, and the number of hops of a route. From the performance comparison, we show that LLR is the best metric when packet decoding errors are dominant over packet losses. ","Nov. 2005",

In a CDMA Unslotted ALOHA system, Multiple Access Interference (MAI) may  bring about error in PR/CA. The MAI mainly stems from already recognized packets and newly arriving packets under the execution of PR/CA. This characteristic of asynchronous transmission in CDMA U-ALOHA systems implies that only one or a few packets arrive at the receiver within a short interval of a execution. Furthermore, newly arriving packets are recognized and code-acquired by using a short preamble part. Consequently, the MAI from the packets under the execution of the PR/CA will be small. Focusing on that point, this paper proposes applying the IC scheme in order to suppress the MAI from the already recognized and code-acquired packets. A performance evaluation demonstrates that such an application is valid due to the small amount of MAI from the packets under the execution of PR/CA. In addition, we demonstrates that the scheme reduces false recognition rather than mis-recognition. Such a scheme improves the performance of not only PR/CA, but also the throughput.","Jun. 2005",

In this paper we consider BFDM/OQAM system with Gaussian transmitter pulse and evaluate channel parameter statistics in multipath time-varying channels.","Jun. 2005",

In indoor environment, transmitted signal fluctuates due to fading and shadowing. To combat the fading and shadowing, macro / micro spatial diversity can be used as an effective countermeasure. In this manuscript, macro / micro diversity is achieved by multiple wireless relay terminals, which is convenient in setting and moving the macro diversity branches. In the proposed scheme, channel between the transmitter and the receiver through relay terminals is considered as a MIMO channel and separation of the signals re-transmitted from the relay terminals is not required. This feature makes it possible to have higher order diversity without the cost of bandwidth inefficiency. By numerical calculations, performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated and the improvement of the reliability of the communication system is confirmed. ","Jun. 2005",

B3G systems should provide services comparable to those offered by wired networks for a variety of applications such as interactive multimedia, VoIP (voice over Internet protocol), network games, videoconferencing, etc. The current trend is that B3G will be based on IP technology, and therefore, all-IP [1] architecture design has been an important research topic in the past few years. Those systems will need to support multiple services ubiquitously in different types of environment including indoor, outdoor (with low and high velocity), and up to global broadband access (satellite). Thus, they would be deployed in a heterogeneous environment of various physical access networks of wireless and wired systems. The network heterogeneity means that the physical access network underlying the B3G system will support different levels of data rates and different mobility and traffic management techniques govern individual systems. In this context, the B3G mobile systems will face at least two predominant constraints: a) heterogeneity in physical access network, and b) change of application types from commonly low data rates into more bandwidth demanding real-time and multimedia ones. In such situation, providing quality of service to users would become even more difficult that what we are currently dealing. One of the main issues involved in the development of B3G systems is the choice of multiple access (MA) technology that could efficiently share the available bandwidth to large number of users. The choice of MA technique could significantly enhance or damage the service quality delivered to end users. It is known that the existing MA techniques used in 2G/3G systems, including those based on time division multiple access (TDMA) and direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) [2], and other combinations of the two schemes are basically suitable for voice communications and not for the burst data traffic, which would be the dominant portion of traffic load in B3G systems. Therefore, the need for developing new MA techniques for B3G becomes imperative. In this article, we will review the main technical concepts of the MA schemes in wireless mobile systems and try to find the path for the development of an appropriate MA scheme for B3G through those fundamentals govern the existing MA schemes. In the following section, multiple access technologies will be reviewed from historical and technical points of view. This review will be followed by a section that provides simple formulization of MA schemes through mathematical expressions that could simplify the process of developing new MA schemes for B3G wireless cellular systems. We will then list the most important features of multiple access schemes in 3G mobile system. Finally we conclude this article by reviewing the most promising MA schemes for B3G mobile systems.","Feb. 2005",

The scheme can achieve a diversity gain by combining multiple copies of the same packet that are transmitted along different routes. We analyze two characteristics of the proposed system. One is the average packet error probability, which is obtained as a function of elapsed time after transmission requests for copied packets are generated. The other is the required time for achieving a required packet error probability. The results are evaluated from a quality of service (QoS) point of view. From numerical results, it is shown that for a given tolerable delay, there exists a number of multiple routes that minimizes the achievable average packet error probability. Moreover, if the number of multiple routes is selected appropriately, the required time for achieving a required packet error probability can be minimized.","Sep. 2004",

In conventional wireless sensor networks, the intermediate node performs the regenerative repeating process such that error correction, detection and re-encoding are processed. This is reliable, but it requires a lot of processing effort and may take much energy. To reduce a burden of relay process, we propose to omit error decoding and/or re-encoding process at the intermediate nodes. Further, we propose a method that realizes soft-decision decoding for hard-detected signals. With this method, we can employ Turbo code to wireless sensor networks. As results, we show that though omitting the decoding and re-encoding process at the intermediate node may not affect much to the performance.","Sep. 2004",

In conventional cooperative diversity systems, space-time coding is used for the separation of the signal from relay terminals. However, these relaying schemes increase the complexity of relay terminals. In this paper, space-time coding is used for a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channel between the source and the destination terminal via relay terminals.

The adaptive interleaving is a method that assigns symbols adaptively to the subcarriers in order to cope with frequency selective fading based on a channel state information (CSI) sent back from the reception end. The concept of adaptive interleaving is to maximize a free Euclidean distance in the limited interleave size. In this paper, we extend the method by an introduction of bit interleaving and multiple trellis coded modulation (MTCM). MTCM assigns two or more symbols to one trellis branch and shows good performance in frequency selective fading. If we could assign those set of symbols with an aid of the adaptive interleaving, the performance improvement can be expected. Another improvement method considered in this paper is the use of bit interleaving. The bit interleaving techniques randomize the effect of channel more efficiently compared to the case of symbols interleaving. Thus the further performance improvement is expected. One draw back is that since the interleaving process is done in bit level, bit interleaving can not be applied to TCM nor MTCM. In this paper, we mainly focus on adaptive bit and symbol interleaving and discuss the  performance from the point of interleaving effect, and the error  correcting code (convolutional code and MTCM).","Jun. 2003",

In this system, a user station can transmit a packet asynchronously and randomly, and so the packet birth/death event is one of the most important problems for multiuser detection. We have proposed the CDMA unslotted ALOHA system using an adaptive filter receiver based on minimum mean square error criterion in [8], and shown the improvement in the throughput performance even considering the effect of birth/death event. The ensemble-averaged squared error, however, increases at the point of packet birth. In this paper, we employ interleaving and forward error correction (FEC) coding techniques to mitigate the momentary increase in ensemble-averaged squared error. The use of FEC, however, causes the increase in MAI due to redundancy bits of FEC. Moreover, signal power is reduced under the condition that the energy of an  information bit is the same. In such cases, whether an adaptive filter can operate effectively or not interests us. We evaluate the system performance and show that the improvement in throughput is achieved with interleaving and FEC techniques.","Sep. 2002",

The introduced modification consists of using different time interval lengths when calculating the time correlations for optimizing the different channel parameters. This modification was proposed for the purpose of a further reduction in the algorithm's computational weight in case of receiving sufficiently resolvable waves. Specifically, we found that short interval windows are sufficient for estimating delays and azimuth angles, which is quite effective in reducing the computational burden in their optimization processes. As for the estimation of the attenuation parameters, a longer time window, equal to the preamble length, is considered for more accurate estimation. Also two other estimators are proposed. The first one combining the modified SAGE with a sequential estimation of the attenuation parameters, suitable for slowly varying channels. Another one, similar to the first, and primarily designed to alleviate the influence of present strong interferers.

Successful packet reception rate, fairness coefficient and throughput performance are evaluated in fading environments with imperfect power control. Computer simulation shows that adaptive transmit permission probability control improves fairness of service for all mobile stations and throughput performance across all channel loads compared with the conventional scheme.

In terrestrial systems,  the power of a received desired/interfering signal is mainly determined by the propagation loss, which is often modeled to be proportional to the fourth power of the propagation distance. On the contrary, in satellite systems, the loss varies as the square of distance and, in addition to the loss, the gain of the beam also affects the interference power. Because of this  difference, the superiority or inferiority of multiple access schemes discussed terrestrial systems may not be adopted for satellite systems. Thus in this manuscript, the performance of FDMA and CDMA  for LEO and terrestrial systems are compared. As a result, it is found that the well-known statement for terrestrial system, i.e., CDMA is superior to FDMA, may not always stands for LEOS systems. ","Jun. 2000",

In this paper, a chip-by-chip Turbo coding for DS/SS systems is proposed. The input information data is first spread by PN sequence and then fed into the Turbo-encoder which operates in chip timing.

We analyze the throughput performance considering packet retransmission and the stability of the systems. Based on these results, we propose an optimal access control protocol (OACP).

We also clarify the stability of the system. Based on these results, we propose the optimal retransmission control (ORC) to improve the performances. The ORC is the scheme to prevent the system from drifting to an undesirable operating point by controlling the birth rate of retransmitted packets. As a result, it is shown that the throughput and delay performances of the system with the ORC are better than without the ORC and the system does not drift to an undesirable operating point.
