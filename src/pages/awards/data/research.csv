The use of a global shutter high-speed image sensor as a receiver has been widely examined in ITS-VLC so far. However, this image sensor is impractical for general-purpose applications due to the high cost. This study aims to perform ITS-VLC using the rolling shutter image sensor. The rolling shutter image sensor is widely used in the smartphone camera. By using it as a receiver, ITS-VLC can be used in more opportunities. In this study, we propose a ITSVLC system using rolling shutter image sensor. The proposed system demodulates data from images captured in a moving environment. We evaluate the communication performance by measuring the bit error rate for the ITS-VLC experiments.","2022年5月",","

Conventional camera-based VLC suffers from low data rates and high latency due to the limited camera frame rates. To solve this problem, the event camera has been used as the receiver in VLC. Event cameras detect changes in brightness and asynchronously output these changes as events in microsecond order. The high temporal resolution gives the event camera-based VLC good potential in terms of high speed and low latency. However, when an event camera is used as the VLC receiver, the light of the transmitter needs to be changed constantly. If the transmitter LED is continuously in the same blinking state, the event camera may not output any events and the data could not be recovered until the blinking state changes. To transmit the optical signal for event cameras, we use a propeller-type rotary LED transmitter for the event camera-based VLC. The transmitter rotates the blinking LED in circles and uses the afterimage of LED light to transmit signals. The event camera detects the afterimages and constantly outputs them as a stream of events. We filter the noise events and recover data using signal events. This study verifies the operation for the proposed system through an implementation experiment. As a result, we achieved the communication in the proposed system and provided a basic evaluation in terms of communication speed and quality.","2022年5月",","

The rotary LED transmitter was developed to increase the data rate of ISC using afterimages of LED lights. The transmitter simultaneously causes the LEDs to blink and rotates them around a vertical axis. Owing to the movement of the blinking LEDs that occurs within the exposure time of the camera, multiple blinking states are captured as afterimages, thus increasing the amount of information that can be received per image. However, with increasing communication distance, the size of the LED light captured on the image sensor decreases. In this case, it is difficult to distinguish each LED blinking state, leading to a degradation of the demodulation performance. To overcome this problem, the proposed STC encodes adjacent angular afterimages as symbol pairs and transmits these symbol pairs using two symbol times. In addition, we simplified the data decoding process by using normalized LED luminance values. We evaluate the demodulation performance of the proposed method through experiments. Compared with conventional coding methods, the proposed STC requires no channel estimation and significantly improves the demodulation performance.","2022年2月","10.1109/JPHOT.2021.3137601,"

Almost once per decade, cellular mobile communication is transformed by a significant evolution, with each generation developing a distinctive concept or technology. Interestingly, similar trends have occurred in OWC systems based on visible light and light fidelity (Li-Fi). Unfortunately, OWC is currently relegated to a limited role in any 5G scenario, but the debate whether this is unavoidable has yet to be settled. Whether OWC is adopted post 5G or 6G is not the vital issue; rather, the aim should be that OWC coexists with 5G and 6G communication technologies. In working toward this goal, research and development in OWC will continue to extend its benefits and standardize its systems so that it can be widely deployed in the market. For example, given that a standard already exists for a visible-light beacon identifier and Li-Fi, a service using this standard should be developed to satisfy user demand. Toward this end, we propose herein a method for visible-light beacon identification that involves using a rolling shutter to receive visible-light communications with a smartphone camera.

This study aimed to prevent such capacity reduction by introducing the superimposition of control signals. Such control signals occupy a frequency bandwidth of the equivalent of only one control signal; therefore, they can prevent the reduction of the overall capacity. The main challenge is estimating the satellites' Doppler frequencies from the waveforms of Doppler-affected superimposed control signals.

Communication in this scheme depends on the quality of images transmitted from the LED to the sensor. If the image becomes unfocused on the way to the receiver, the LED luminance that make up the signal cannot be detected, so the receiver cannot demodulate the signal data. To overcome this problem, this study proposes a novel demodulation scheme to recover data from a degraded image, based on a maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) algorithm. The proposed method creates template images that imitate all possible blinking patterns produced by the LED transmitter, and then calculates the Euclidean distances between pixels in the captured image and the pseudo images for all possible blinking patterns. Finally, the algorithm chooses the image template with the smallest Euclidian distance from the received signal as the recovered data. Though an exhaustive set of image templates must be prepared for the proposed MLD, the number of templates depends on the number of LEDs on the transmitter. Thus, the computational complexity of this method increases as the number of transmitter LEDs increases. To reduce the computational complexity of the proposed MLD algorithm, the binary differential evolution (BDE) algorithm is used, which is a swarm intelligence technique. Computer simulations are used to evaluate the BDE algorithm's usefulness for reducing computational complexity and improving the BER of the communication system.","2019年4月","10.1587/nolta.10.173,"

E10-N, no. 1, pp. 106-114, 2019.","Stochastic resonance (SR) is a noise-enhancement phenomenon that enables the detection of sub-threshold signals by adding noise and using nonlinear systems. This paper explores the applicability of SR in a BPSK receiver with sub-threshold signals. Although received signals are amplified as a result of the nonlinear behavior of the receiver, they are somewhat distorted. This results in the lower performance of SR receivers in comparison with linear receivers. Employing a parallel network of SR systems is expected to solve this problem. The present theoretical analysis demonstrates that in a certain noise intensity range, the output of the network can fully describe an input sub-threshold signal, and hence, the performance close to that of the linear receivers can be obtained. The effectiveness of the SR receiver was also demonstrated through a numerical example of the bit error rate (BER). However, achieving good BER performance requires an infinite number of arrayed SR systems, which is not realistic in practical systems. A design framework for an SR network with a finite number of elements and an appropriate noise intensity that can realize BER performance close to that in linear systems is also provided.","2019年1月","https://doi.org/10.1587/nolta.10.106,"

VLC using image sensors as receivers is referred to as image sensor communication (ISC). ISC eliminates noise and interference and enables multiple and simultaneous communication; hence it is suitable for outdoor mobile environments such as intelligent transport systems (ITSs). On the other hand, since the communication rate depends on the frame rate, it is difficult to increase. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to increase the communication rate by multilevel pulse width modulation (PWM). When the modulation level is increased, demodulation becomes difficult due to the bit per pixel (bpp) limitation of the image sensor. First, in order to perform efficient luminance extraction in limited bpp, we compare the maximum luminance extraction and the average luminance extraction. Then, we propose improving the nonlinearity between the transmitter and receiver, which is a problem in average luminance extraction suitable for a mobile environment, by applying precoded PWM. Finally, we evaluate effectiveness of precoded PWM experimentally.","2018年12月","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2018.8644347,"

We show that the nonlinear signal processing dramatically improves the detectability of the weak signal, supported by an interference signal generated by an appropriate beam control of the antenna arrays. The method takes advantage of subthreshold signal detection by the Stochastic resonance. To postulate a performance of the interference-aided detection, we numerically evaluate the channel capacity provided by the proposed diversity reception on a fading model.

Li-Fi (light fidelity) and OCC (optical camera communication) or also know as CamCom are also VLC family.  
Li-Fi is a high-speed wireless system and is currently in the process of being standardized in IEEE 802.11.  
The OCC uses an ordinary camera, e.g. a smartphone camera, as a receiver while ISC uses a high-speed image sensor as a reception device.  The principal component of a camera, an image sensor, is used for both ISC and OCC.  
The main difference is that ISC focuses on a high-speed image sensor while OCC concentrates on low-cost consumer applications using smartphones and similar contemporary devices.
For automotive usage, a high-speed image sensor is the best choice for the VLC receiver because the image sensor has a spatial separation of noise and target source.

The VLC family uses LED as the transmitter and LED light sources are everywhere on streets: in signs, traffic lights, street lights, and other stationary objects.  
So if we can send IDs or exact location data (latitude and longitude) by way of VLC from those LEDs, then they can be used as anchor nodes placed on roads, sidewalks, or landmarks.  
Those anchor nodes help autonomous cars and connected vehicle for robust navigation with centimeter accuracy.  
The image sensor is the suitable detection device as it can be used for both positioning and VLC data detection.

In this paper, we measured actual vehicle vibration in a driving situation and determined parameters based on the frequency characteristics.

Based on the principle of m-point discrete Fourier transform (DFT), a phase shift keying (PSK) signal is transmitted over m consecutive time slots mT, where T is a slot duration. In practice, the symbol rate of this paper is R/(m + 1) because a guard slot is inserted every m slots. In the superimposed system, N data streams where the symbol rate of the nth data stream, n = {1, 2, . . . , N}, is 1/(m + 1)n-1 times the symbol rate of the first data stream are combined to form a pulse-width modulated (PWM) wave with a period time T. An IS receiver with a camera operating at a frame rate of R/(m + 1)n-1 fps demodulates data streams whose symbol rate is R/m + 1)n symbol/s or lower. Our experimental results validate that from a superimposed PWM wave of 500-symbol/s and 125-symbol/s data streams, a 2000-fps camera receiver demodulates both of the two data streams and the 500-fps camera receiver does the 125-symbol/s data stream successfully, without shortening individual error-free transmission ranges, compared with non-superimposed systems in which 500-symbol/s and 125-symbol/s data streams are independently transmitted by different light emitting diode (LED) transmitters and received by 2000-fps and 500-fps camera receivers, respectively.","2017年12月","10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254784,"

The UTMS is a traffic management system beneath the National Police Agency of Japan. Currently, 55 000 UTMS infrared beacon systems have been installed, and they provide expressway and ordinary road information to cars. However, the data rate is 1 Mbps, and a faster data rate is necessary to support automotive and smart mobility devices. In this paper, we propose an uplink V2I system for the UTMS. The system is designed to match the current beacon system as closely as possible, so that the system can easily be replaced and still provide sufficient bandwidth for future automotive and smart mobility devices. We adopt a photo diode (PD) as the VLC receiver and a commercially available off-the-shelf LED headlight as a transmitter. Unfortunately, the bandwidth of such an LED is usually small, so we consider applying a bit-loading algorithm to direct-current-biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing. To reduce strong background noise, such as from the sun, we narrow down the field-of-view by applying a lens to the PD, which forms a tiny communication area, smaller than the current infrared beacon system. We then consider multiple PDs with the lens to create a similar communication area as the infrared beacon system. As a result, we achieve 3.1-Mbps throughput.","2017年10月","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2759179,"

"山里敬也","車車間・路車間通信","電磁環境工学情報 月刊EMC, vol.29, no.8, pp.98-109","自動運転の研究開発は，1960年代から始まっており，その度に話題に上ってきた．Google による自動運転プロジェクトに触発されたことが原因と思うが，現在，自動運転に関する話題がマスコミを賑わしている．我が国の自動運転研究開発の第一人者である津川定之氏によると，現在のブームは第4期であり，ここに来てようやく実用化を目指した技術の検証が始まっている状況であり，加えて，各国政府も自動運転車を睨んだ政策・規制の立案に着手しつつある(1)．また，自動車メーカも2025年以降の自動運転車のリリースを発表するなど，自動運転はまさにホットトピックと言っても過言で無い．
　現在，検討されている自動運転車の多くは自律走行車である．具体的には，車輌に搭載されたレーダ，LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)，車載カメラ，超音波センサなどを用いて車輌周辺の詳細な3次元地図を作成し，この地図情報と予め車輌に持ち合わせている情報およびGPS等で得られる外部情報からコンピュータが総合的に解析し、ハンドル、アクセル、ブレーキなどの運転に必要となる動作を行う仕組みである(2)．自律走行車は，特段のインフラ設備も必要としない，つまり，自動車メーカの努力で実現できる可能性がある．また，ディープラーニングなどの高度な画像認識技術，人工知能（AI）など自動運転に必須の演算・処理も，コンピュータの計算能力が飛躍的に増加した現在では，実用レベルで利用できる状況にある．このことも自律走行車の実用化に向けた研究開発を促進させている理由と考えられる．
　一方で，今後の自動運転車の動向に目を向けると，自律走行車を基礎にしつつも，路車・車車間通信を活用することで道路インフラおよび周辺車輌と常時情報交換を行いながら走行する，いわゆる「つながる車（コネクテッドカー）」が注目される(3)．とりわけ，その基盤となる路車・車車間通信については，実用に耐えるシステム運用が始まったばかりであり，自動運転車を見据えた今後の動向に注目が集まっている(4)．
　道路インフラから車輌に対し情報伝送を行う路車間通信システムは，道路側の漏洩同軸ケーブルを用いてカーラジオ（AM波）で伝送する路側放送に始まり，VICS（Vehicle Information and Communication Systems），そして 5.8 GHz帯DSRCによるITSスポットとして進展している．また，有料道路における料金自動収受システム（ETC: Electronic Toll Collection）も路車間通信システムである．さらに，警察庁のITSプロジェクトによって設置された光ビーコンによるUMTS（Universal Traffic Management System）も路車間通信による交通情報を提供している(5)．
　車車間通信システムとしては，700 MHz 帯高度道路交通システム（ARIB STD-T109）がある．このシステムで利用する周波数帯は，もともとアナログTV放送で使用していた周波数帯である．それまでも，5.8 GHz帯狭域通信(DSRC)システムを用いて車車間通信を行うことができたが，5.8 GHz 帯は、電波の直進性が強く、ビル影、大型車の後方等の見通し外には、電波が回り込みにくい．このため，ビルや壁に囲まれた交差点等の見通し外での利用に適さないとの指摘があった．そこで，700 MHz帯をITSに利用する案が検討され，2011年12月には総務省から認可された(4)． 
　本稿では，我が国における路車・車車間通信について解説する．とりわけ，現行の路車・車車間通信システムである700 MHz 帯高度道路交通システム（ARIB STD-T109）を取り上げ，その概要を紹介する．700 MHz 帯高度道路交通システム（ARIB STD-T109）は，当初（2007年）は車車間通信システムとして検討が始まったが，その後，2009年には車車間・路車間共用方式として検討され，2012年の完全デジタルTVの移行の年にARIB STD-T109として標準化されている．この方式の特徴としては，単一周波数帯の共用による車車・路車共用通信方式がある．本稿では，この概説を中心に述べていく．
　本稿は次のように構成される．まず第2章ではITSと関連する無線通信技術の略史について述べる．容易に想像できることであるが，無線通信技術の進展に歩調を合わせるように自動車向け無線通信技術も進展している．とりわけ，携帯電話の普及に伴う技術の進展，各種デバイスの小型・省電力化は大きいと考える．また，自動運転技術もまた無線通信技術の進展に呼応する形で発展しており，興味深い．第3章では現行の路車・車車間通信システムである700 MHz 帯高度道路交通システム（ARIB STD-T109）について概説する．第4章では，未来のITSとそれを支える無線通信技術，とりわけ未来の自動運転車である「つながる車」について筆者の愚考を述べる．最後に第5章でまとめる．","2016年12月",","

Toward the future in which vehicles are connected anytime and anywhere by optical signals, the cutting-edge camera receiver employing a special CMOS image sensor, i.e., the optical communication image sensor (OCI), has been prototyped, and an optical V2V communication system applying this OCI-based camera receiver has already demonstrated 10-Mb/s optical signal transmission between real vehicles during outside driving. In this paper, to reach a transmission performance of 54 Mb/s, which is standardized as the maximum data rate in IEEE 802.11p for V2X communication, a more advanced OCI-based automotive VLC system is described. By introducing optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (opticalOFDM), the new system achieves a more than fivefold higher data rate. Additionally, the frequency response characteristics and circuit noise of the OCI are closely analyzed and taken into account in the signal design. Furthermore, the forward-current limitation of an actual LED is also considered for long operational reliability, i.e., the LED is not operated in overdrive.

A noteworthy feature of high-speed image sensors is their ability to be used as a reception device for visible light communication (VLC) signals. Due to the massive number of pixels available and the ability to spatially separate sources, a signal-receiving pixel in the image sensor plane represents the actual position of the transmitter. The VLC signal can be represented not only by a VLC time domain signal but also by the position of the transmitter. In this paper, we propose a robust range estimation scheme that integrates with a VLC function for infrastructure-to-vehicle visible light communication (I2V-VLC). The scheme is composed of an LED array transmitter and a high-speed image sensor receiver. It measures a range by taking phase-only correlation (POC) and avoids vehicle vibration from road irregularity. Field trials confirm an accuracy range of 0.3 m, even on rough road conditions, with the measurement time of 2 ms, which is much faster than that of light detection and ranging (LIDAR).","2016年5月","10.1109/ICCW.2016.7503808,"

Few attempts have so far addressed the development of SR receivers to show the feasibility of subthreshold signal detection.

Although a considerable amount of research has focused on indoor VLC systems using singleelement photodiodes, there remains a need for channel modeling of VLC systems for outdoor mobile environments. In this paper, we describe and provide results for modeling image sensor based VLC for automotive applications. In particular, we examine the channel model for mobile movements in the image plane as well as channel decay according to the distance between the transmitter and the receiver. Optical flow measurements were conducted for three VLC situations for automotive use: infrastructure to vehicle VLC (I2V-VLC); vehicle to infrastructure VLC (V2I- VLC); and vehicle to vehicle VLC (V2V-VLC). We describe vehicle motion by optical flow with subpixel accuracy using phase-only correlation (POC) analysis and show that a single-pinhole camera model successfully describes these three VLC cases. In addition, the luminance of the central pixel from the projected LED area versus the distance between the LED and the camera was measured. Our key findings are twofold. First, a single-pinhole camera model can be applied to vehicle motion modeling of a I2V-VLC, V2I-VLC, and V2V-VLC. Second, the DC gain at a pixel remains constant as long as the projected image of the transmitter LED occupies several pixels. In other words, if we choose a pixel with highest luminance among the projected image of transmitter LED, the value remains constant, and the signal-to-noise ratio does not change according to the distance.","2015年9月","10.1109/JSAC.2015.2432511"

have so far been made to adopt it as a modulation scheme of
an image sensor based OWC system. There remains a need
for an evaluation of adopting an optical OFDM to the image
sensor based OWC systems. Another important issue needs to
be addressed is the performance degradation due to a frequency
response of an actual image sensor device, especially a signal
attenuation loss in higher frequency. In addition to such loss, a
narrow band noise generated by its circuits also degrades the
performance. The purpose of this paper is to investigate BER
performances of the optical-OFDM using an actual image sensor
device, the optical communication image sensor (OCI). From
simulation results, it is found that the frequency response and the
narrowband noise at 12MHz of the OCI lead to the significant
reduction of BER performances. Additionally, the results shows
that ACO-OFDM shows a little better performance compared to
DCO-OFDM with the same bandwidth efficiency.","2014年11月","10.1109/APCCAS.2014.7032786,"

A photodiode detects the signal intensity of incoming light, while an image sensor not only detects the incoming signal intensity but also an accurate angle of arrival of light emitted from a visible light transmitter such as a white LED light. After angles of arrival of light are detected by an image sensor, positioning and data reception can be performed. The ability of an image sensor to detect an accurate angle of arrival will provide attractive applications of VLC such as pose, position calculation, and range estimation.

In particular, V2I-VLC and V2V-VLC are presented. While previous studies have documented the effectiveness of V2I and V2V communication using radio technology in terms of improving automotive safety, in the present article, we identify characteristics unique to image-sensor-based VLC as compared to radio wave technology. The two primary advantages of a VLC system are its line-of-sight feature and an image sensor that not only provides VLC functions, but also the potential vehicle safety applications made possible by image and video processing. Herein, we present two ongoing image-sensor-based V2I-VLC and V2VVLC projects. In the first, a transmitter using an LED array (which is assumed to be an LED traffic light) and a receiver using a high-framerate CMOS image sensor camera is introduced as a potential V2I-VLC system. For this system, real-time transmission of the audio signal has been confirmed through a field trial. In the second project, we introduce a newly developed CMOS image sensor capable of receiving highspeed optical signals and demonstrate its effectiveness through a V2V communication field trial. In experiments, due to the high-speed signal reception capability of the camera receiver using the developed image sensor, a data transmission rate of 10 Mb/s has been achieved, and image (320 × 240, color) reception has been confirmed together with simultaneous reception of various internal vehicle data, such as vehicle ID and speed.","2014年7月","10.1109/MCOM.2014.6852088"

The M-ary modulation scheme can transmit b-bit data at a time by using M=2b distinct sequences. In order to generate M distinct sequences and recover b-bit data, the proposed system separates the chaotic dynamics having the chaotic sequence by using M interleavers, and reconstructs the original sequence based on the chaotic dynamics from the separated one by using M deinterleavers. In advance, each data symbol among M symbols is allocated to each interleaver-deinterleaver pair. The transmitter selects an interleaver corresponding to a data symbol and separates the order of samples of the chaotic sequence using the selected interleaver. The receiver feeds the received sequence into all M deinterleavers and outputs M reconstructed sequences. The proposed system can reconstruct the original chaotic sequence only when the correct deinterleaver, which becomes paired with the interleaver, is selected. Therefore, the receiver can recover b-bit data by analyzing the chaotic dynamics of each reconstructed sequence. We carry out computer simulations and evaluate performances of the proposed M-ary modulation scheme. ","2014年4月","10.1587/nolta.5.210"

However, due to the diffusion of LED and the finiteness of the pixel size of image sensor, the focused LED will affect not only the actual corresponding pixel but also its surrounding pixels. We call this phenomenon as “interpixel interference (IPI)” and it causes degradation in error rate performance. To mitigate the IPI, we propose IPI cancellation scheme for the R2V-VLC system.

The traffic light is composed of a hundred of LEDs on two dimensional plain. In this system, data is sent as two dimensional brightness patterns by controlling each LED of the traffic light individually, and they are received as images by the camera. Here, there are problems that neighboring LEDs on the received image are merged due to less number of pixels in case that the receiver is distant from the transmitter, and/or due to blurring by defocus of the camera. Because of that, bit error rate (BER) increases due to recognition error of intensity of LEDs To solve the problem, we propose a method that estimates the intensity of LEDs by solving the inverse problem of communication channel characteristic from the transmitter to the receiver. The proposed method is evaluated by BER characteristics which are obtained by computer simulation and experiments. In the result, the proposed method can estimate with better accuracy than the conventional methods, especially in case that the received image is blurred a lot, and the number of pixels is small. &copy; (2013) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

With a simplified model of multi-hop WSNs, we change the transmission schemes, the sizes and transmission distances of
clusters to investigate their effects on the cluster lifetimes. Furthermore, linear and uniform data aggregations are considered in our model.

Conventionally, the hierarchical coding has been realized through the wavelet transform that has a limitation of number and disposition of LEDs, and as a result it does not always match with the design of the transmitters (e.g. traffic lights, etc.) used in real life. To solve the limitation
problem, we propose a more flexible way of designing the application of LEDs depending on the transmitters. In particular, overlay coding is realized through the procedures of coding and decoding. In coding, we replace one LED with a flexible number of LEDs, and the number depends on whether the data is high-priority or low-priority, then high-priority data and low-priority data are overlaid. In decoding, we first obtain the high-priority data, and then the low-priority data using retrieved high-priority data. The experimental result shows that the distance for receiving error-free data is extended from 30m to 70m in the overlay coding.","2011年10月","10.1109/ITSC.2011.6082943,"

"T. Yamazato, S. Haruyama","[Tutorial]  Visible Light Communications","IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), Kyoto, Japan","Visible light communications (VLC) is the latest optical wireless communications technologies that uses low-power light emitting diodes, or LEDs, not only to provide light but also to broadcast data. LEDs are extremely energy-efficient and predicted to become widespread in general lighting application. It is expected that LED market will reach $29 billion in 2017 that is comparable to today's NAND and DRAM markets [1]. Because LED is a solid-state lighting device, it can be modulated at high-speed compared with other lighting sources. VLC uses LEDs, which send data by flashing light at speeds undetectable to the human eye.
The pioneer of VLC using LEDs is Professor Masao Nakagawa of Keio University. His first paper on this subject appeared in the early 2000, together with his successor Prof. Shinichiro Haruyama, the instructor of this tutorial. Later in 2003, he formed Visible Light Communication Consortium (VLCC). Now VLCC is lead by Prof. Haruyama. Please see the following video, an interview of Prof. Haruyama about VLC, which has been broadcast by NHK World in June 4, 2009. http://www.naka-lab.jp/movie/nhk_world.wmv
So far various experimental VLC systems and prototypes are demonstrated. Such includes 4.8kbps visible light ID as an infrastructure to mobile-terminal application, independent sound transmission through RGB visible lights and 100Mbps VLC wireless LAN system. Using LED array, the data rate of 1 Gbps achieved by Keio University (Prof. Haruyama) that is the fastest at the moment [1]. In terms of longer range, there has been a demonstration by VLCC that achieved 1kbps transmission of the distance 2km, that is the world's longest distance for VLC. Samsung and ETRI are also active in developing VLC applications. They have demonstrated 120Mbps full duplex mobile-to-mobile transmission and 100Mbps signboard transmission. Please see the following video of Nakagawa lab. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEh5f49LsB4
Widespread use of LEDs in traffic applications and growing interest in Intelligent Transport System (ITS) presents an opportunity for VLC. Data transmission using LED traffic lights, LED road illumination, and LED brake lights are typical application. Dr. Yamazato, the instructor of this tutorial, is a leader in VLC application to ITS and he recently achieved 16kbps data transmission and distance up to 70m in a driving situation with a vehicle moving with 30km/h. Today VLC using LED is a hot topic and VLC projects have been initiated in Europe and US. In 2006 Siemens launched VLC project. Later in 2008, European Commission established OMEGA project with a consortium of 20 European partners from industry and the scientific community [3]. Meanwhile, in 2008, the US National Science Foundation has approved a grant of $18.5 million to help establish and the Engineering Research Center focuses on VLC. The members of the Center include the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, Boston University and the University of New Mexico. The University of California also have launched five-year research project called the Ubiquitous Communication by Light (UC-Light) that is founded with $3.5 million from the University. The project is anticipated to begin in 2009 and run for five years.
VLC is in the process of standardization by the IEEE 802.15 TG7 and VLCC as well as other standard organizations. The first VLC specification standard was released from JEITA in conjunction with VLCC in 2007. Later in 2008, VLCC released their first specification standard adopting and expanding the IrDA physical layer. IrDA transceiver transmission wavelength (IrDA physical layer) is expanded to accommodate the visible light wavelength. By adapting this specification, the existing IrDA optical modules can be used for VLCC data transmission with slight modification. In January 2009, IEEE 802.15 (Wireless Personal Area Networks) Task Group 7 (Visible Light Communication) has been launched. At the 6th meeting held in November 2009 they adopted the baseline draft text for the development of the 802.15.7 standard.
The goal of this tutorial is to introduce current VLC technology and its trends. Starting with an overview of VLC, participants will learn basics of VLC, on-going standardization activities and VLC. We will provide some experimental results and furthermore detail to enhance VLC application.

As results of the computer simulation, we confirm that the advantage gained in BER performance of the proposed error-correcting method is about 1-1.5 dB compared to conventional method. In addition, we achieve that the proposed error-correcting scheme is performed without the new additional redundancy code by using the chaotic dynamics.","2010年10月",""

LEDは従来の白熱灯と比較して低消費電力、視認性の良さや長寿命といった利点があり、LED信号機が普及しつつある。LEDは半導体デバイスであるため、人の目には見えないほど高速に点滅させることによって照明光であると同時に、通信機器としての役割も果たすことが可能である。また、カメラを用いる利点として、受信機の視野角を広くできる点、送信機の位置を容易に見つけることができる点、複数光源からの信号を同時に受信可能である点などが挙げられる。
一方で、送受信機間の距離に応じた受信画像の劣化が起こるという問題点もある。この受信画像の劣化は(画像の)空間周波数の高周波成分が減衰しているためである。本研究では、LEDアレイの各LEDに別々の情報を載せるため、空間周波数が劣化すると各LEDを個別に判定することができず、一様に誤りが生じる。この問題点を解決するために、階層的符号化方式を用い、長距離からでは失われてしまう高周波成分に優先度の低いデータを、多く残る低周波成分に優先度の高いデータを割り当てる。

We encounter the situation in an intersection where two or more cars are crossing by. Due to the hidden terminal degradation, poor throughput performance is obtained with OFDM scheme. On the other hand, MC-CDMA has a resistance to the hidden terminals as it can support simultaneous packets. However, the transmission data rate is much slow because of the spreading. Thus the total throughput may not be as high as the OFDM. 
As results, we show that throughput of the OFDM is better than the MC-CDMA in a low traffic region. We found that the OFDM can communicate only with the nearest car. On the contrary, when the traffic is high, the MC-CDMA shows better throughput than the OFDM. In addition, we show that many packets can be received simultaneously in MC-CDMA. These results lead to the conclusion that when we want high-speed communication to a few cars, the OFDM is a good candidate. And when low speed but simultaneous communication with many surrounding cars is our desire, then the MC-CDMA is our choice. As MC-CDMA has a compatibility with an OFDM by setting a spreading factor to one, MC-CDMA system may be the preferable choice for IVC.","2008年8月","10.1109/ISSSTA.2008.40,"

Correctly received signals at some relay terminals are re-transmitted to the receiver with the spatial diversity by STBC cooperative relaying scheme. To achieve high diversity order with the conventional STBC cooperative relaying scheme, relay terminals which re-transmit the signals are required to exchange signaling information with each another. However, the exchanging of the information causes delay of the signal transmission. Thus, in this manuscript, a novel signaling scheme for the STBC cooperative relaying is proposed.

We encounter such a situation in an intersection where two or more cars are crossing by.
In a hidden terminal situation, the CSMA scheme may degrade throughput.
On the other hand, CDMA slotted ALOHA has a resistance to the hidden terminal situation as it can support simultaneous packets.
However, the transmission data rate is much slow because of the spreading.
Thus the total throughput may not be as high as the CSMA based OFDM even in a hidden terminal situation.
As a result, we show that the CSMA based OFDM system shows better total throughput than CDMA slotted ALOHA in all region.

もともと，コースウェアとは，授業中に配布されるシラバス，講義スケジュール，講義ノート，参考資料，小テストなど一連の教材を指す．

1990年代に学校にコンピュータが導入されるようになると，これら一連の教材が CD-ROM などでまとめて配布，利用されるようになった．当然だが，この教材キットを有効に活用して教育効果を高めよう，自学自習教材として活用しようということになってくる．

これらの流れから教育用ソフトウェアとして認識されるようになったのだろう．

オープンコースウェア（OpenCourseWare: OCW）のコースウェアには，教育ソフトウェアという意味は含まれていない.
ソフトウェアでは無く，あくまでも「教材」をまとめた教材キットである．

しかしながら，実際には，ソフトウェア著作者の権利を守ることを前提にしている場合が多い．オープンソースでは，ソフトウェア著作者の権利を守りつつも，ソフトウェアのソースコードを無償公開することで，より良いソフトウェアの開発を行うことを目指している．

オープンコースウェアはオープンソースの「オープン」と「コースウェア」からなる造語で，コースウェア（教材）をオープン（著作者の権利を守りつつ教材の使用あるいは改良の許諾条件を与える）にしていくこと，との意味になる．
オープンソースと同じように，公開することで良い意味でのフィードバックが期待でき，結果として教育の質の向上を目指している．

We evaluate signal constellations
and bit error rate performances while considering quantization errors and clippings. The optimum range for an ADC input amplitude is
found as a result of the trade-off between quantization error and the effects of clipping. In addition, it is shown that the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the signal is not a good measure of the bit error rate (BER) performance,
since the largest peaks occur only with very low probabilities.
The relationship between the location of a subcarrier and its performance
is studied. 
As a result, it is shown that the influence of the quantization
error is identical for all subcarriers, while the effects of clipping depend on
the subcarrier frequency. 
When clipping occurs, the BER performance of a
subcarrier near the center frequency is worse than that near the edges.","2006年12月",""

In this study, we propose an iterative channel decoding scheme that uses them with weighting. We show that when the number of sensor nodes is increased, decoding performance improvement cannot be achieved by simple weighting, and so a more appropriate weight is needed.

To overcome these issues, we use a multiple route coding scheme in which packets are transmitted on multiple routes from a user node to multiple base stations. This scheme can achieve a diversity gain by combining packets that are transmitted along multiple routes. 
Some challenges must be met to establish multiple routes for this scheme. In this paper, we propose a routing protocol for multiple route coding.

Using the status of error detector, it is possible to give an accuracy to the received signal so we can improve the performance by soft decoding.","2005年9月",","

In indoor environment, transmitted signal fluctuates due to fading and shadowing. To combat the fading and shadowing, macro / micro spatial diversity can be used as an effective countermeasure. In this manuscript, macro / micro diversity is achieved by
multiple wireless relay terminals, which is convenient in setting and moving the macro diversity branches. In the proposed scheme, channel between the transmitter and the receiver through relay terminals is considered as a MIMO channel and separation of the signals re-transmitted from the relay terminals is not required. This feature makes it possible to have higher order diversity without the cost of bandwidth inefficiency. In numerical
examples, the performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated by average frame-error rate and outage probability of frame-error rate. With two relay terminals, the diversity gain of the proposed scheme is about 5-6 dB, which is 1 dB higher than that of conventional macroscopic diversity. ","2005年9月",","

Each digit of the code word is assigned to sub-packets on multiple routes. At the intermediate nodes, the sub-packets are regenerated-relayed to the next node. The sub-packets transmitted via multiple routes are decoded by the Viterbi decoder with the modified metric computation at the destination node.

In a CDMA Unslotted ALOHA system, Multiple Access Interference (MAI) may  bring about error in PR/CA. The MAI mainly stems from already recognized packets and newly arriving packets under the execution of PR/CA. This characteristic of asynchronous transmission in CDMA U-ALOHA systems implies that only one or a few packets arrive at the receiver within a short interval of a execution. Furthermore, newly arriving packets are recognized and code-acquired by using a short preamble part. Consequently, the MAI from the packets under the execution of the PR/CA will be small. Focusing on that point, this paper proposes applying the IC scheme in order to suppress the MAI from the already recognized and code-acquired packets. A performance evaluation demonstrates that such an application is valid due to the small amount of MAI from the packets under the execution of PR/CA. In addition, we demonstrates that the scheme reduces false recognition rather than mis-recognition. Such a scheme improves the performance of not only PR/CA, but also the throughput.","2005年6月",""

B3G systems should provide services comparable to those offered by wired networks for a variety of applications such as interactive multimedia, VoIP (voice over Internet protocol), network games, videoconferencing, etc. The current trend is that B3G will be based on IP technology, and therefore, all-IP [1] architecture design has been an important research topic in the past few years. Those systems will need to support multiple services ubiquitously in different types of environment including indoor, outdoor (with low and high velocity), and up to global broadband access (satellite). Thus, they would be deployed in a heterogeneous environment of various physical access networks of wireless and wired systems. 

The network heterogeneity means that the physical access network underlying the B3G system will support different levels of data rates and different mobility and traffic management techniques govern individual systems. In this context, the B3G mobile systems will face at least two predominant constraints: a) heterogeneity in physical access network, and b) change of application types from commonly low data rates into more bandwidth demanding real-time and multimedia ones. In such situation, providing quality of service to users would become even more difficult that what we are currently dealing. 

One of the main issues involved in the development of B3G systems is the choice of multiple access (MA) technology that could efficiently share the available bandwidth to large number of users. The choice of MA technique could significantly enhance or damage the service quality delivered to end users. It is known that the existing MA techniques used in 2G/3G systems, including those based on time division multiple access (TDMA) and direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) [2], and other combinations of the two schemes are basically suitable for voice communications and not for the burst data traffic, which would be the dominant portion of traffic load in B3G systems. Therefore, the need for developing new MA techniques for B3G becomes imperative. 

In this article, we will review the main technical concepts of the MA schemes in wireless mobile systems and try to find the path for the development of an appropriate MA scheme for B3G through those fundamentals govern the existing MA schemes. In the following section, multiple access technologies will be reviewed from historical and technical points of view.

This review will be followed by a section that provides simple formulization of MA schemes through mathematical expressions that could simplify the process of developing new MA schemes for B3G wireless cellular systems. We will then list the most important features of multiple access schemes in 3G mobile system. Finally we conclude this article by reviewing the most promising MA schemes for B3G mobile systems.","2005年2月",""

From numerical results, it is shown that the performance degradation of the system is mainly caused by the increase of packet delay, which is due to the increase of the traffic intensity.

Some works have been done about discovering the received signal-power distribution which makes MAI be suppressed effectively. This distribution minimizes the averaged Bit Error Rate(BER). However, in packet communication systems, it is dominant to the performance if packets can be transmitted successfully or not. Even if the averaged BER is high, many packets can be correctly transmitted.
It implies that the optimum distribution on averaged BER does not give the best performance of packet transmission.In this paper, the received signal-power distribution which gives the best performance of packet transmission is derived. Such a distribution will make clear the limit of performance improvement using SIC.","2004年9月",""

In this case, however, packet errors caused by a channel may lead to a loss of transmitted information directly. Then, it is necessary to employ a technique which can reduce the influence of packet errors. We propose to employ a multiple-route packet combining scheme in real-time communications on wireless multihop networks. The scheme can achieve a diversity gain by combining multiple copies of the same packet that are transmitted along different routes. We analyze two characteristics of the proposed system. One is the average packet error probability, which is obtained as a function of elapsed time after transmission requests for copied packets are generated. The other is the required time for achieving a required packet error probability. The results are evaluated from a quality of service (QoS) point of view. From numerical results, it is shown that for a given tolerable delay, there exists a number of multiple routes that minimizes the achievable average packet error probability. Moreover, if the number of multiple routes is selected appropriately, the required time for achieving a required packet error probability can be minimized.

The adaptive interleaving is a method that assigns symbols adaptively to the subcarriers in order to cope with frequency selective fading based on a channel state information (CSI) sent back from the reception end. The concept of adaptive interleaving is to maximize a free Euclidean distance in the limited interleave size. In this paper, we extend the method by an introduction of bit interleaving and multiple trellis coded modulation (MTCM). 

 MTCM assigns two or more symbols to one trellis branch and shows good performance in frequency selective fading. If we could assign those set of symbols with an aid of the adaptive interleaving, the performance improvement can be expected. Another improvement method considered in this paper is the use of bit interleaving. The bit interleaving techniques randomize the effect of channel more efficiently compared to the case of symbols interleaving. Thus the further performance improvement is expected. One draw back is that since the interleaving process is done in bit level, bit interleaving can not be applied to TCM nor MTCM. 

 In this paper, we mainly focus on adaptive bit and symbol interleaving and discuss the  performance from the point of interleaving effect, and the error  correcting code (convolutional code and MTCM).

communication system. 
In this system, a user station can transmit a packet 
asynchronously and randomly, and so the packet birth/death event is 
one of the most important problems for multiuser detection.
We have proposed the CDMA unslotted ALOHA system using an adaptive filter
receiver based on minimum mean square error criterion in [8], 
and shown the improvement in the throughput performance 
even considering the effect of birth/death event.
The ensemble-averaged squared error, however, increases at the point
of packet birth.
In this paper, we employ interleaving and forward error correction (FEC)
coding techniques to mitigate the momentary increase in ensemble-averaged
squared error.
The use of FEC, however, causes the increase in MAI due to redundancy bits
of FEC. Moreover, signal power is reduced under the condition that the 
energy of an  information bit is the same. In such cases, 
whether an adaptive filter can operate effectively or not interests us.
We evaluate the system performance and show that the improvement in
throughput is achieved with interleaving and FEC techniques.

In our analysis, we compare the performance between the two
basic techniques of ALOHA protocol, i.e., Slotted-ALOHA (S-ALOHA) and 
Unslotted-ALOHA (U-ALOHA), when combined with CDMA scheme 
to support voice and data users operating in same CDMA channel. 

The quality of service (QoS) required for voice and data media is
completely taken care of. We obtain the throughput of data media, and
the outage probability for voice considering both voice and data offered loads.

Throughput performance of S-ALOHA technique is almost twice of that of 
U-ALOHA. However, we show in this letter that when we combine
CDMA with the two basic techniques of ALOHA to accomplish multimedia transmission, 
both techniques have almost same performance. And, thus, CDMA U-ALOHA can 
be a good candidate for multimedia networks.

CDMA方式が脚光を浴び始めたのはアメリカのQualcom社が米国での新しい自動車・携帯電話システム（現在ではcdmaOneと呼ばれている）を提唱した1990年頃からである．当時、アメリカではアナログＦＭ方式を用いたAMPS(Advanced Mobile Phone System)を使ったセルラ方式が運用されていたが、セルラ無線用の周波数がニューヨーク、ロサンゼルス、シカゴなどの大都市で著しく不足しており、周波数利用効率の高いセルラシステムが渇望されていた．このため、AMPSの３倍の加入者数増の望めるFDMA/TDMA混在方式の検討がすすめられていた．ところが、Qualcom社はそのセールトークの中でAMPSに比べ収容加入者数が18倍にも達する、と述べたのである．

18倍という数字はいささか大袈裟な感もあるが、それ以降、CDMA方式の研究が盛んに行われる様になったのは事実である。日欧を中心に開発がすすんでいる広帯域CDMA(W-CDMA)は、
世界標準の無線伝送技術として2001年の実用化をめざし、急ピッチで開発が行われている\cite{adachi-JSAC98}。

In this paper, we propose a new decoding scheme for compressed video signal with TURBO code. Powerful error correction can be achieved as a result of recursive decoding structure of TURBO code. In proposed scheme, reference frame for interframe is decoded by alternative H.263 decoder and TURBO decoder. Thus, error correction may be achieved more as a result of longer decoding process time by TURBO decoder.","1998年12月",""
